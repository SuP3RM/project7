# Udacity Project 7 Neighborhood Map

### Description from Udacity
You will develop a single-page application using React featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a list view to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).
