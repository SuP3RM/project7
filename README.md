# Udacity Project 7 Neighborhood Map

### Based on Udacity's description
I developed a single-page application using React featuring a map of Chicago neighborhoods. Then I added additional functionality to this app, including map markers (to identify popular locations), a list view to support simple browsing of all locations, and a search function inside the list to easily discover these locations. I researched and implemented third-party APIs (Foursquare) that provide additional information about each of these locations.

### How to run?
1. Install node and npm
2. Clone this repo with git or download and extract via zip
3. Open terminal and change directory (cd) into project root file
4. Run npm install
5. Run npm start (or 'yarn start' if installed)
6. Open browser to localhost:3000 (incognito mode works best)
7. Enjoy! :D
